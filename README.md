##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) model built using historical financial data (FY23–FY25) to forecast FY26 performance for Britannia Industries.

###  Objective
- Analyze historical revenue and margin trends  
- Identify key business and cost drivers  
- Build a driver-based forecast model  
- Perform Base, Upside, and Downside scenario analysis  
- Design an executive-level financial dashboard  

---

##  Historical Performance Insights

- Revenue growth accelerated in FY25  
- EBITDA margin peaked in FY24 (~19%)  
- Margin pressure observed in FY25  
- Raw material cost (~60% of revenue) identified as the primary margin driver

- Pricing power  

### Cost Drivers
- Raw material inflation (dominant risk factor)  
- Advertising spend as discretionary lever  
- Relatively stable employee cost structure

##  FY26 Forecast & Scenario Analysis

The model includes three scenarios to evaluate financial risk exposure:

| Scenario   | EBITDA Margin |
|------------|--------------|
| Base       | ~17%        |
| Upside     | ~19.5%      |
| Downside   | ~14.5%      |

###  Key Insight
A 1% change in raw material cost ratio materially impacts EBITDA, highlighting high margin sensitivity to commodity inflation.
